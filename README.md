# Monster Friends

Monster Friends is an ongoing personal education education where I use CSS art to improve my skills and amuse myself.

## Description

CSS art is a fun and efficient way of improving one's front-end skills. Inspired by UI legends such as [Diana Smith](https://github.com/cyanharlow), I like to experiment with CSS graphics in my spare time.

This repo is the home for some of those experiments. I'm particularly proud of the "green monster" in this scene, since he is comprised of only a single HTML div!

Monster Friends is an ongoing personal-education project, so it's constantly changing and may not look so great on a given day. I hope this repo makes you smile, and inspires you to play around with your own CSS art!
